What is text summarization?

The process of producing a brief, precise, and efficient summary of a lengthy text content is known as text summarization. It involves extracting the most crucial details from a source material. A prominent issue in machine learning and natural language processing is automatic text summarization (NLP). In order to better assist in the discovery of relevant information and to consume relevant information more quickly, approaches for automatic text summarising are urgently needed.
